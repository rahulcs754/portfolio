    <h3 class="title">What is Closures in JavaScript? ðŸ¤”</h3>
    <p>
        A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Why we need closer ? ðŸ¤”</strong> 
        <p>it is make function have private variable.</p>
        <p>  
           Explain with example:
            <br><br/>   
            let assume, we create a function that will counter after every click on the button. so first I have declared " x = 0 ". and then create a function with the name " add() ". Whenever I clicked the " add button ". that action access the "call add()"   function. In this function,  we can increase our counter easily. But x is a global variable that can access by any other function. 
            We want to declare a function that has its own private variable.
            For that we use closure.JavaScript supports nested functions. In closure,  we declare a variable under the outer function and that variable only accesses the inner function.  
            
Code Example: 

<textarea class="code">
const add = (function () {
let counter = 0;
return function () {counter += 1; return counter;}
})();
</textarea>

</p>
